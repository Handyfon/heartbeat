Make hp changes exiting and immersive!
Heatbeat adds an overlay for hurt characters similar to a video game. This module is system agnostic and very customizable!

<b>Manifest: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Handyfon/heartbeat/main/module.json</b> 

The less hp a character has the higher the visibility of the overlay.
